This project is a keyboard translator. You can use a new ones keyboard AT model on PC-XT 8088.
Uses a simple STM32C011 with open-drain ports and 5V tolerant inputs, you can install the chip
 only reducing the voltage with a voltage regulator to 3V and connecting directly to keyboar and PC. Or
 just reduce the power supply from 5V to 3V with another methodes like using diodes. There are on folder 
 Fusion360  a schematic and pcb designs. 





⚠️ Low-voltage equipment: Always follow appropriate isolation practices.
