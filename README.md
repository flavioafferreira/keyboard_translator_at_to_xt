This project is a keyboard translator. You can use a new ones keyboard AT model on PC-XT 8088.
Uses a simple STM32C011 with open-drain ports and 5V tolerant inputs, you can install the chip
 only reducing the voltage and connecting directly to keyboar and PC.
 Just reduce the power supply from 5V to 3V. You can do it using diodes. 





⚠️ Low-voltage equipment: Always follow appropriate isolation practices.
